						Coral reefs play an essential role in maintaining the health of our oceans and supporting human life. 
						Coral reefs also protect coastlines from erosion and storm surges, acting as natural barriers. 
						Moreover, they contribute to tourism and offer potential medicinal compounds. 
						Their preservation is critical, as they are both a source of life and a shield for coastal communities.

								<h3>Acropora Retusa</h3>
								<h4>An endangered coral in the epipelagic zone.</h4>
								<p>This zone is dominated by stony corals, also known as scleractinian corals.</p>
								<p>They are one of the largest and most important genera of reef-building corals, particularly in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean regions.</p>
								<p>Acropora retusa is under threat due to climate change (including ocean warming and ocean acidification), diseases, habitat degradation, land-based sources of pollution, small population size, unsustainable fishing.</p>

								<h3>Orbicella Annularis</h3>
								<h4>An endangered coral in the mesophotic zone.</h4>
								<p>Black corals and gorgonians, belonging to the orders Antipatharia and Alcyonacea respectively, dominate this zone.</p>
								<p>Black corals, whose Greek name "antipathes" means "against diseases," have long been valued for their medicinal properties. Their extracts have been used to treat various ailments, including bacterial infections, fever, inflammation, ulcers, and lung conditions.</p>

								<h3>Isidella Elongata</h3>
								<h4>An endangered coral in the benthic zone.</h4>
								<p>Isidella elongata, a soft coral in the order Scleralcyonacea, plays a key role in deep-sea ecosystems by forming colonies that enhance habitat complexity and support species like epibionts, cephalopods, and sharks. These habitats increase local biomass, attracting invertebrates and commercially important species such as red shrimp and Norway lobster.</p>
								<p>However, deep-sea fishing, especially bottom trawling, has severely reduced its populations. Once abundant in the Mediterranean, it is now scarce due to fishing and sediment displacement. Its slow growth, long lifespan (~400 years), and limited dispersal make recovery from damage very difficult.</p>
