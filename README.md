## Introduction

Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and valuable ecosystems on Earth. They provide habitat and shelter for many marine organisms, protect coastlines from storms and erosion, and contribute significantly to the economy through fisheries and tourism. However, these vital ecosystems face numerous threats, including climate change, overfishing, and pollution.
